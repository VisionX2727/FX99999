# Fleet Manager

Fleet Manager is a mobile-first operations app for small fleet owners to track vehicles, daily work, fuel, drivers, customers, khata balances, receipts, and profitability.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server (port 5000)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` or `SUPABASE_DB_URL` — Postgres connection string for the backend workspace database

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- Build: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Where things live

- `artifacts/fleet-manager/src/pages/` — main mobile screens for home, fleet, logs, khata, fuel, analytics, drivers, calculator, and settings
- `artifacts/fleet-manager/src/lib/store.tsx` — local-first fleet data model and persistence
- `artifacts/fleet-manager/src/lib/supabase.ts` — Supabase browser client and Google OAuth configuration
- `artifacts/fleet-manager/src/index.css` — industrial yellow/steel visual theme

## Architecture decisions

- The first milestone is local-first so the app remains usable offline and keeps records across reloads.
- Supabase is used for Google OAuth, logout, and business-logo storage; the authenticated API uses the Supabase service role only on the server to upload logo bytes to the private server boundary, while the workspace record stores the resulting public asset URL.
- Khata charges are linked to work logs and vehicles so receipts and payment QR amounts are derived from recorded work.

## Product

Users can register vehicles, record work and fuel by vehicle/date, assign drivers, track driver pay, manage customer khata ledgers, generate UPI payment QR codes, download receipt text, view vehicle profitability, use a persistent calculator, and save business details/logo for receipts.

## User preferences

_Populate as you build — explicit user instructions worth remembering across sessions._

## Gotchas

_Populate as you build — sharp edges, "always run X before Y" rules._
